    <h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
    
<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
        holiday. but during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
        Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.

pictures, stories, and films. And if you can join my email list, I will keep you
up to date on all things Halloween.
